## Introduction to Bevy

Bevy is an open-source game engine built in Rust that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It leverages a data-driven Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, which allows developers to create complex game behavior while maintaining high performance and scalability.

**Why Choose Bevy?**
- **Rust's Safety**: Bevy inherits Rust's memory safety and concurrency features.
- **Data-Driven Design**: The ECS model promotes clean and maintainable code.
- **Active Community**: Bevy has a growing community that actively contributes to its development and offers support.
